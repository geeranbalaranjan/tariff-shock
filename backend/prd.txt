## 0. Track Alignment Summary

| Track | How TariffShock Aligns |
|---|---|
| **Best Use of Data Visualization** | Interactive risk leaderboards, before/after scenario deltas, and trade-flow breakdowns make complex trade data immediately understandable. |
| **Best Use of AI for Good** | Preventative, explainable decision-support that helps policymakers anticipate economic harm and reduce unintended consequences of tariffs. |
| **Best Use of Gemini API** | Gemini translates quantitative risk outputs into plain-English insights and policy-ready summaries, improving accessibility and trust. |

## 1. Problem Statement

Global trade policy changes—such as tariffs, trade wars, and border taxes—introduce sudden and uneven economic risk across Canadian sectors and companies.

Current gaps:
- Lack of **quantitative, explainable** tools to assess exposure.
- Analyses are often static, backward-looking, or opaque.
- No intuitive way to **simulate “what-if” tariff scenarios** and see impacts instantly.

**TariffShock** fills this gap by **quantifying**, **explaining**, and **simulating** tariff risk exposure for Canadian sectors (with optional company views).

---

## 2. Product Vision

Enable users to **anticipate and understand tariff shocks before they occur**, empowering faster, fairer, and more informed decisions through transparent data and simulation.

---

## 3. Goals & Success Criteria

### Primary Goals
1. Quantify tariff risk exposure for Canadian sectors.
2. Simulate hypothetical tariff scenarios in real time.
3. Explain *why* risk changes using interpretable AI.

### Hackathon Success Metrics
- End-to-end demo in ≤2 minutes.
- One compelling, realistic scenario walkthrough.
- Judges understand the logic without technical background.
- Clear value proposition per track.

---

## 4. Target Users

### Primary
- Policy analysts and economists  
- Finance and investment analysts  
- Supply chain and trade risk professionals

### Secondary
- Students and researchers  
- Journalists and educators

---

## 5. User Stories

- **As an analyst**, I want to rank sectors by tariff risk so I can prioritize monitoring.  
- **As a policymaker**, I want to simulate tariff changes and see downstream impacts before decisions are made.  
- **As a user**, I want clear explanations for *why* a sector’s risk score changed.  
- **As a judge**, I want to immediately see the decision this tool enables.

## 6. Core Features (MVP)

### 6.1 Sector Risk Leaderboard (Data Visualization Track)
- Ranked list of Canadian sectors by **Tariff Risk Score (0–100)**.
- Columns:
  - Risk score
  - **Δ Risk** vs baseline (post-simulation)
  - Top export partners
  - Export dependency %

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Sorting by risk and Δ risk.
- Color-coded deltas (increase/decrease).
- Click-through to sector detail view.

---

### 6.2 Scenario Simulation Engine (AI for Good Track)
Users can simulate:
- **Tariff increase (%)** (0–25%)
- **Target partners** (US, China, EU, All)
- **Sector / product group** (e.g., steel, autos, lumber)

Live updates:
- Risk scores and rankings
- Affected export value (clearly labeled proxy)
- Highlighted “most impacted” sectors

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Updates render in <1s for demo datasets.
- Clear baseline vs shocked comparison.
- Assumptions visibly labeled.

---

### 6.3 Explainability Panel (Gemini API Track)
For a selected sector:
- Top 3–5 risk drivers (e.g., partner exposure, concentration).
- Quantitative contribution breakdown.
- **Gemini-generated plain-English explanation**, e.g.:
  > “Risk increased primarily due to heavy reliance on US exports and high product concentration in steel.”

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Gemini output references actual numeric inputs.
- Tone is non-technical and policy-appropriate.
- One-click “Generate Briefing” summary.

---

## 7. Out of Scope (Hackathon)

- Real-time tariff ingestion pipelines
- Long-term macroeconomic forecasting
- Firm-level financial predictions
- Production-grade accuracy guarantees

---

## 8. Data Requirements

### Trade Data
- Canadian export values by:
  - Sector / HS category
  - Trading partner country

### Tariff Data
- Curated or simulated tariff deltas for major partners/products

### Optional (Stretch)
- Company revenue by geography
- Historical tariff event indicators

---

## 9. Risk Modeling Approach

### 9.1 Sector Tariff Risk Score
Normalized score combining:
- **Exposure**: share of exports to tariff-affected partners
- **Concentration**: dependency on few partners/products
- **Shock magnitude**: simulated tariff increase

Conceptual formula:
Risk = (Exposure × w1 + Concentration × w2) × Shock


Weights are fixed and documented for transparency.

---

### 9.2 Simulation Logic
Changing scenario inputs recalculates:
- Affected export value (proxy)
- Updated sector risk scores
- Sector ranking deltas

---

## 10. Explainability & Gemini Integration

### Gemini Responsibilities
- Convert numeric drivers into natural-language explanations
- Generate policy-ready summaries (≤120 words)
- Answer “Why did risk change?” prompts grounded in data

**Prompt Inputs**
- Sector name
- Scenario context (partners, tariff %)
- Risk components and deltas

**Output Constraints**
- No speculative claims
- Explicit references to provided metrics

---

## 11. UX & Demo Requirements (Data Visualization)

### Must-Have
- Interactive sliders/dropdowns
- Immediate visual feedback
- Baseline vs shocked comparison

### Nice-to-Have
- Bar charts or heatmaps
- Preloaded demo scenarios
- Exportable summary view

---

## 12. Non-Functional Requirements

- Fast and stable for live demos
- Clear labeling of assumptions
- Interpretability prioritized over precision
- Accessible color palette and typography

---

## 13. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Data gaps | Use proxies; disclose assumptions |
| Oversimplification | Position as decision-support, not prediction |
| Time constraints | Sector-level MVP; company layer optional |

---

## 14. Future Extensions

- Company-level exposure scoring
- Trade war escalation pathways
- Integration with market indicators
- Policy optimization recommendations

---

## 15. Track-Specific One-Sentence Pitches

- **Data Visualization:**  
  *TariffShock turns complex trade data into intuitive, interactive visuals that reveal where tariff risk concentrates—and how it shifts under policy changes.*

- **AI for Good:**  
  *TariffShock uses explainable AI to help policymakers anticipate and mitigate economic harm before tariff decisions are made.*

- **Gemini API:**  
  *TariffShock leverages Gemini to translate quantitative risk models into clear, policy-ready explanations accessible to non-technical decision-makers.*
